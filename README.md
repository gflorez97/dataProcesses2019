# Domain of interest
The selected domain of interest for this project is basketball, and in particular, professional basketball in the United States (the NBA). It is an interesting domain, as more and more data is available daily as games are played, and being able to analyze all that data properly is starting to become a priority for professional teams. Also, it's a sport we know about and like, and thus we can compare the results of our analysis to our previous knowledge.
